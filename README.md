# Intuto - AI-Powered Presentation Generator

Intuto is an intelligent web application that instantly transforms any PDF document into a beautiful, engaging presentation. It leverages the power of Google's Gemini API to not only generate slides with relevant visuals but also provides an interactive, RAG-enabled chat interface to discuss the document's contents.

## Key Features

-   **PDF to Presentation Conversion**: Upload any PDF and watch as Intuto automatically generates a structured slide deck, complete with titles and concise bullet points.
-   **AI-Generated Visuals**: Each slide is automatically enhanced with a unique, contextually relevant background image generated by AI, making your presentation visually stunning.
-   **RAG-Enabled Chat**: An interactive chat assistant is available alongside your slides. It uses the original PDF as its knowledge base (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to answer your questions accurately.
-   **Context-Aware Navigation**: As you chat about the document, the app intelligently jumps to the most relevant slide, keeping the visual context in sync with the conversation.
-   **AI Auto-Tutor**: Launch an automated presentation mode where an AI tutor explains each slide with generated speech, providing a hands-free learning experience. Two speed modes ("Rapid" and "Normal") are available.
-   **Voice-to-Text Input**: Use your microphone to ask questions in the chat, offering a natural and accessible way to interact with your document.
-   **Persistent Sessions**: All your generated presentations ("Spaces") are saved in the browser's local storage, allowing you to revisit them later.

## How It Works

The application follows a streamlined, multi-step process to transform a static document into an interactive experience:

1.  **PDF Upload & Text Extraction**: The user uploads a PDF file. The `pdf.js` library is used to parse the document and extract its entire text content.
2.  **Slide Generation**: The extracted text is sent to the **Gemini 2.5 Flash** model with a detailed prompt and a strict JSON schema. The model analyzes the text and returns a structured JSON object containing an array of slides, each with a title and a maximum of four bullet points with corresponding Font Awesome icon suggestions.
3.  **Visual Asset Creation**: In parallel, for each generated slide title, a request is made to the **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image** model. It generates a high-quality, professional photo that visually represents the slide's concept.
4.  **Interactive Editor**: The generated slides and images are rendered in the main application view. The UI consists of a slide outline for easy navigation, a main viewer for the current slide, and a control panel.
5.  **RAG-Powered Chat**: When a user sends a message, the query is sent to the **Gemini 2.5 Flash** model along with the original PDF text as context. This ensures the AI's responses are grounded in the source material. After a response is received, another call determines the most relevant slide to display.
6.  **AI Auto-Tutor with TTS**: When the user starts a tutoring session, the application iterates through each slide. For each one, it calls the **Gemini Flash Lite** model to generate a concise spoken explanation. This text is then sent to the **OpenAI TTS API** to convert it into speech, which is played back using the Web Audio API. Audio for the *next* slide is prefetched to ensure a smooth, uninterrupted playback experience.

## File Structure

The project is organized into a modular structure to separate concerns:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── (Static assets if any)
├── src/
│   ├── components/       # Reusable React components (SlideViewer, ChatInterface, etc.)
│   ├── services/         # Modules for external interactions (Gemini, PDF, TTS)
│   ├── App.tsx           # Main application component, state management
│   ├── index.tsx         # React app entry point
│   └── types.ts          # Core TypeScript type definitions
├── index.html            # Main HTML file with import maps for dependencies
└── README.md             # This file
```

## Setup & Configuration

This application is designed to run in a web environment where dependencies are managed via an import map in `index.html`.

### API Keys

The application requires API keys for both Google Gemini and OpenAI services.

1.  **Google Gemini API Key**:
    -   This is expected to be available as an environment variable `process.env.API_KEY`. The application code in `services/geminiService.ts` will automatically pick it up.
    -   Ensure this variable is properly configured in your deployment environment.

2.  **OpenAI TTS API Key**:
    -   In the current version, this key is hardcoded in `services/ttsService.ts`.
    -   **For production use, it is strongly recommended to move this key to a secure environment variable** and load it in the same way as the Gemini key.

### Running the Application

1.  Ensure you have a web server to serve the static files.
2.  Set up the `API_KEY` environment variable for your Gemini key.
3.  Serve the `index.html` file from the root of the project. Any simple HTTP server will work.

## API Usage Details

Intuto strategically uses different AI models for different tasks to optimize for quality, speed, and cost.

-   **`gemini-2.5-flash`**: The primary model used for:
    -   Generating the initial slide structure from the PDF text.
    -   Powering the RAG chat, providing answers based on the document context.
    -   Analyzing chat conversations to find the most relevant slide index.
-   **`gemini-2.5-flash-image`**: A specialized model for generating high-quality images. It's used to create a unique visual for each slide title, significantly improving the presentation's aesthetic appeal.
-   **`gemini-flash-lite-latest`**: A faster, more lightweight model used to generate the concise spoken explanations for the Auto-Tutor feature, ensuring low-latency audio generation.
-   **OpenAI `tts-1`**: This model is used for its high-quality text-to-speech capabilities, providing a natural-sounding voice for the AI Tutor.
